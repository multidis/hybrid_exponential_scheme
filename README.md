# Hybrid-exponential scheme for stochastic Volterra equations
This project implements the hybrid-exponential scheme of (Rømer, ?) for simulating stochastic Volterra equations (SVE's).

[EQUATION OF SVE]

Explain SVE.

Explain basics of scheme and U-factors?

The project also contains code for approximating a given kernel function K(t) by a sum of exponential functions as in (x). 

See the folder '.../get_started' for scripts to help you get started.
 
# Example
[Simulate rough Bergomi] + show paths + paths of U factors
